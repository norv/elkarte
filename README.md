Goals:
===
* always easy to install and use, simple and flexible
* customizable
* easy to share content with external applications (email, social networks, blogs, feeds)
* powerful template system
* performance

Elk makes it simple and fun to run your own forum, personalize it, and use it any way you want and from where you want.


History:
===
ElkArte is the 3rd iteration of the forum software known previously as YabbSE and SMF.

In 2003, YabbSE developers have rewritten the software, and have changed its name to SMF. Its simplicity and user friendliness have served users needs for the next decade.
In 2011, SMF 2.0 final has been released, under an open license: BSD 3-clause license.
In the 10th year of the project's existence, SMF developers have decided to cut all ties with simplemachines.org, and fork the project, under the name ElkArte.

ElkArte is a rewrite of the SMF codebase in a significant measure. It brings the software to MVC architecture, making the codebase more flexible with an object oriented approach, and extensible mostly without the need of code modifications.

Elk is a Free and Open Source project.
Our core values are quality, openness, and fun.
